# Explore Wrapprs

The [Explore tab](https://www.wrappr.wtf/1/explore) allows you to review public Wrapprs. 

After paying a minting fee, you can send a Wrappr NFT to your chosen account, such as a DAO or multisig. 

These NFTs will be viewable on other NFT gallery sites such as [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) and [LooksRare](https://looksrare.org/), as well as your wallet, such as [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/).
