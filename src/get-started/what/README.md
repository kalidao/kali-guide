# What is Wrappr?

[Wrappr](https://wrappr.wtf/) is a platform to launch and mint legal NFTs, such as limited liability "legal wrappers" for DAOs and wallets. 

Users can select through premade options, such as LLC formation, or explore a gallery of other NFTs deployed by the public.

## Benefits

Through key-signable documents, Wrappr NFTs allow users to have limited liability either as a contributor or to wrap a DAO. 

For example, a developer receiving a grant is often required to have a legal entity and Wrappr makes it easier to structure a pass-through LLC precisely with their receiving wallet. In other cases, a DAO may want to clarify its status as a non-profit association and remove partnership liability for DAO members, or a multisig investment club may want to purchase equity through an LLC.

Minting a Wrappr can also provide optimizations around tax jurisdiction, ownership of RWA, and legal claims, such as software licensing and IP.

The benefit of using NFTs to incorporate are threefold:

(1) *Paperwork is easy to find* and can be shown in a wallet or DAO treasury through multiple apps.
(2) *Incorporation is completely online*: Users control how much info they want to reveal at all times, pay in crypto, and their legal status is machine-readable.
(3) *Secure recordkeeping*: Important documentation is permanently uploaded to the blockchain and IPFS and cannot be hacked.

Users can also be sure that their Wrapprs are up-to-date with the best terms and legal frameworks as they are [maintained in open source](https://github.com/kalidao/kali-legal) with a wide range of contributors.

The premade options drafted by crypto lawyers for immediate use are LLC, Non-Profit and Charter NFTs.
