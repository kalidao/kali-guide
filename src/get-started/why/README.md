## ðŸ¤” Why use Wrappr?

Wrappr NFTs can do a lot of things. They can wrap wallets and DAOs with limited liability and allow them to own IRL assets by representing legal entities. They can provide a novel path to fundraising (SAFTs), and many other use cases we haven't seen yet. The code is the limit (and well, it's super flexible) and the law is long.
